This jupyter book contains all the steps to reproduce the results of the paper
"Inference of 3D genome architecture by modeling overdispersion of Hi-C data".


**This material is still under construction**

1. Are contact counts overdispersed?
2. Simulating HiC datasets
3. Performing the inference with Pastis-NB
