# Stability analysis of 3D structure inference

The scripts in this folder are used to assess:
- stability analysis with respect to replicates
- stability analysis with respect to resolution
- whether including 0 contact counts or not yields to better performances.

We've run those experiments on a cluster. We provide the slurm scripts to run
them:

- launch_all_jobs.sh runs all the jobs on the cluster. These are run as a
  series of job arrays.
- the scripts/ folder contains the individual bash scripts.


You can also download the results of the 3D inference at
